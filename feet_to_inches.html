            In the United States, the two length units that are most frequently used are feet (ft) and inches (in).
            Schools, daily life, the arts, and various branches of science and engineering all make use of the units.
            The feet to inches conversion is useful and important, so here's the formula and examples that show how to
            convert <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/feet-to-inches">feet to inches</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Feet to Inches Formula</h2>
        <p>
            Although it isn't quite as simple as converting between metric units, which are just multiples of 10, it is
            still not a difficult process.<br>
            The conversion factor is:<br>
            <span id="formula">foot = 12 inches</span><br>
            <span id="formula"> In inches = (distance in feet) x (12 inches/foot)</span><br>
            So, to convert a measurement in feet to inches, all you need to do is multiply the number by 12. This is an
            exact number, so if you're working with significant figures, it won't limit them.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Let's say you measure my living room and find it is 22.4 feet across. Find the number in inches?
        </p>
        <p>
            length in inches = length in feet x 12<br>
            length = 22.4 ft x 12<br>
            length = 268.8 or 268 inches<br>
        </p>
